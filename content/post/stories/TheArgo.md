## The Argo

&emsp;So I had this idea, late at night, as all good ideas arrive. An idea for a story based in hard science fiction with mild horror and thriller elements. It's not a terribly sophisticated idea, but I liked the setting and speculative technology.

### The Setting

&emsp;I wanted to set this story on an [O'Neil cylinder](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/O%27Neill_cylinder) called the Argo. This has a few advantages, as it's a pretty self-contained environment and there's a lot of creative freedom in the environment. However, it's also a helluva a challenge. You have to describe the setting in a way that makes sense to an audience that's spent their entire life on Earth. A quick rundown of features that are hard to describe and unintuitive:

- The horizon curves up.
- Anyone on the cylinder can look up and see anywhere else.
- The "inner space" between the habitable interior surface and the exposed outer surface.
- Gravity *decreases* as you go up towards the central spoke.

&emsp;The wider world of the story is effectively set in the late 2300s, as humanity has started colonizing nearby star systems. FTL is impossible and near-lightspeed travel comes with insurmountable engineering challenges in the form of energy requirements and micrometor impact damage. So, the colonization ships need to be habitats capable of self-sustaining for hundreds, possibly thousands of years. 

&emsp;This makes for a crazy cool and unique setting, but it's also basically impossible to describe without being a god of prose or using an illustration. It's also hard to draw a world that's just so weird and unintuitive, and I'm not good at drawing. But, I LOVE this setting, and want to do a lot more with it, but right now, I don't have the illustrative chops to deal with it.

### The Characters

- Dae. Our protagonist, a mechanical engineer ~20 years old working on a capstone project. That's literally all that I developed him with. Yeah, he's paper-thin. Following a five-man band structure, he's nominally the Leader, but usually comes off more as the Lancer or Big Buy. When I left the story, he hadn't really *done* anything.
- Marc. Affable ace, best friends with Dae, who's kinda a replacement for his often-absent parents. He switches between the Heart and the Leader. In my mind, I had him the most developed, but it's still not great.
- Ava. Computer programmer on the same capstone project team as Dae. I didn't develop her much personally, but she fulfils the Smart Guy role, sometimes switching in for the Heart. Best friends with Sarah.
- Sarah. Nominally the leader until she gets damseled and puppeted by Blue Sky. She has very little characterization beyond "tough guy who doesn't take shit." She's basically a walking plot device, and while I planned to characterize her with a recovery from being damseled and puppeted, but stopped writing before that. I was going to do a "break the badass," but stopped first.
- Antonin. Doesn't even deserve a mention, as he does basically nothing and I practically forget he exists.
- Blue Sky. A moxel construction designed to maintain the Argo and protect its inhabitants, but has interpreted that directive more broadly than originally intended. It enforces a lower tech level, fights off Red Sky, and puppeteers Sarah. It's basically amoral, only trying to fulfill the objective. Not exactly a protagonist, but was intended to be a protagonist-aligned character after they free Sarah and fight through Blue Sky's swarms.
- Red Sky. Calls itself by a numerical address, became a paperclip maximizer focused on terraforming, as it was a bot working on the Martian terraforming effort. Intent on destroying the enclave in the Argo and using the ship's resources to expand to the stars. The antagonist, it's amoral, just as Blue Sky; it just has a very different objective.

## the Problems

&emsp;I'm just going to give a list.

- Paper-thin characters. I didn't think them through at all.
- Uncertain story. I didn't go in with any coherent story in mind besides a few key scenes and some twine between them.
- Undeveloped world. I didn't really know *how* my world worked before writing it.
- Undeveloped character interactions. Besides the relation between Marc and Dae, I didn't really have anything in mind.

### The Fixes

&emsp;Writing a proper long-form story is *hard*. I keep underestimating the difficulty and assuming I can plow through with gumption and goodwill. That's not how the world works, and my poor decisions usually catch up with me around page 50. What I need to do is learn to think through a world ***first***. Make notes, write everything down, come up with an organization system (maybe this website). Whenever I've tried to organize before, I usually run into issues with quick referencing back - I can't find the information I need. That sounds like an issue with my organization system, and I should probably try to break things down and solve the problem like an engineer.

&emsp;Also, I should write short stories of the different scenes I like to get a feel for the world. The first section of the Argo story isn't actually that bad; I basically wrote it as a short story featuring the characters I'd figured out. I think it does an alright job at characterizing them, introducing conflict, and building suspense. Those short stories are also a smaller load to try to think through. They don't require nearly as much long-term planning.

&emsp;The main problem I'll run into with trying to write short stories is that I like to think **big**. My mind will start with a short story and spiral out to the whole fictional world. This spiraling, while enticing and initially fun, tends to gloss over details and introduce inconsistencies. I need to set a specific, pre-defined endpoint to a short story and *stick to it*. Anything more can be the subject of a future short story or part of the larger world. Who knows, maybe it'll make its way to a post here.
