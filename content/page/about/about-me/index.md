&emsp;Hey there! I'm Sebastien, a young engineering student. Mostly, I love 3D printing and building stuff. I want to put stuff together and see how it all works. I also like history, biology, natural history, and just about everything. I'd usually describe myself as an affable hyper-nerd with a Wikipedia addiction, a gentle and modern ape. Give me an interesting problem, narrative, or world, and I'll be entertained for a long while.

&emsp;While I am an engineer at heart, I also like creating stories. While I am not very good at it, I'm not the worst person I've read. My main problem is that I can't ever *finish* a project, so maybe pushing some of them here will help me? I'll see how it works out, and it's not like anyone's gonna kill me over some mediocre stuff I wrote on the internet.
