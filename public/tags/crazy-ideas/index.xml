        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-inspiration&#34;&gt;The Inspiration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December 2023, I watched an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om9Id44vjKw&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;animation by Liam Vickers on youtube&lt;/a&gt; about a character named IC-0n. IC-0n&amp;rsquo;s gimmick is that she&amp;rsquo;s basically omnipotent, off-beat funny, and has a penchant for murder. And while this specific combination captivated me for a few months, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liked IC-0n&amp;rsquo;s giant robot arms. The idea had already been in my head for a while thanks to the show Inside Job, where one of the main characters invents GIANT ROBOT ARMS(!!!!). There were also a few animations where characters had mechanical wings, and I thought they looked &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cool. So, I decided I had to make some of my own and wear them for my last day of school. I had a 3D printer and six months to spare, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; hard. Right? This would be my first real &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; project, and as such, has proved to be a valuable lesson in &amp;ldquo;dos&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;ts&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ic-0n&#34;&gt;IC-0n
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to go on. The hand I wanted to base on IC-0n&amp;rsquo;s talons, and the arm segments on Inside Job, but not much more. Most of the content I used was also animated, and the animators hadn&amp;rsquo;t really worried about the mechanical or physical feasibility of their arms, so I had a tough time trying to figure out what exactly to build. I took a few screenshots and tried to piece together exactly what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the IC-0n screenshots are wildly inconsistent and mechanically impossible. Fortunately, this gave me a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of artistic license to make design and manufacturing simplifications. I decided to go with a hand design similar to the top images and bottom-center images, as those seemed to be the most realistic. Each finger would be built with a metacarpal, phalanx, and claw, or the first, second, and third segments respectively. I&amp;rsquo;d use three fingers and a thumb, each with the same standardized construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The boxy palm seen in IC-0n&amp;rsquo;s character art was an almost immediate no-go. It would have been hard to assemble and probably exceeded my build volume. I decided to design the palm as a much more open frame, looking more like the tendons in your hand. Originally, I also wanted to be able to actuate the hands with a bowden cable, which necessitated a more complicated design with actuation levers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inside-job&#34;&gt;Inside Job
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/p/giant-robot-arms/image6.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I knew that this would be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to recreate in real life, because this design is basically impossible. The arms should be too heavy for Reagan to hold on a small backpack, the arms get &lt;em&gt;wider&lt;/em&gt; as they get farther from the base, and the hands are just ridiculous - they were made to look cool as hell, not to be mechanically accurate. But I wanted to make something that &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; similar and had the same feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the end, I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d go for a similar cylindrical design for the arms, but with &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different joints. This may have ultimately been a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arm-design&#34;&gt;Arm Design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;base&#34;&gt;Base
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; I decided to build the whole thing to fit inside an old backpack because that was the cheapest way I could think to make something that I could put on my back. I designed a backplate that was glued into the backpack, keeping the whole system rigid and providing attachment points. I also put some giant weights in the backpack as ballast against the weight of the arms in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interlocking-arms&#34;&gt;Interlocking Arms
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; I originally designed two types of arms &amp;ldquo;single&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;interlocking.&amp;rdquo; The single arms were a single 30cm long print, while the interlocking arms were three joined prints coming to 60cm long. Problem is, I underestimated how &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; 60cm is. I guess my American brain just isn&amp;rsquo;t used to intuiting metric measurements, and in practice, the interlocking arms were way too big. The single arms were plenty long enough and could be combined pretty easily. They were also easier to carry, so whenever I wore the arms, I only used single arm segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;omnidirectional-joints&#34;&gt;Omnidirectional Joints
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is probably the worst-designed part of the assembly. Realistically, I should have gone with a design closer to the Inside Job animation, with bulkier and thicker joints that didn&amp;rsquo;t have so many thin sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an image of the final design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/p/giant-robot-arms/image7.PNG&#34;
	width=&#34;975&#34;
	height=&#34;507&#34;
	srcset=&#34;http://localhost:1313/p/giant-robot-arms/image7_hu63c1852050b15f1dd5f2d2cb1751fc7c_63667_480x0_resize_box_3.PNG 480w, http://localhost:1313/p/giant-robot-arms/image7_hu63c1852050b15f1dd5f2d2cb1751fc7c_63667_1024x0_resize_box_3.PNG 1024w&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;192&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;461px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Given how thin most of the part is, it was the most common point of failure. While it did meet design requirements on a small scale, I&amp;rsquo;d failed to think about it as part of the whole system and an actual load-bearing part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rotational-joints&#34;&gt;Rotational Joints
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; In hindsight, these were a terrible idea. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give them more than a few sentences because they just fell apart and didn&amp;rsquo;t work at all. The problem they were meant to solve could have been fixed by using the Inside Job joint design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hand-design&#34;&gt;Hand Design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;palm&#34;&gt;Palm
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; The palm was a pain to design, given its weird angles. I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to mention it, to be honest. It just took a lot of time. I originally designed it so that the hand could articulate, but after some real-life testing, that was quickly shown to be impractical. I had a hard time making the palm large enough in relation to the fingers but small enough to fit on my build plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;metacarpal-phalanx-and-claw&#34;&gt;Metacarpal, Phalanx, and Claw
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; These parts were designed together, and honestly, I think I did a decent job recreating the feel of IC-0n&amp;rsquo;s hands. These were held together with 3D printed pins and pressure-fit nuts. This actually worked pretty well, and when held in position by the actuator rods, they looked &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/p/giant-robot-arms/image8.PNG&#34;
	width=&#34;1201&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;actuators&#34;&gt;Actuators
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; These were the parts that were supposed to move the hands - the small linkages on the image above. I&amp;rsquo;d originally tested these with a cardstock and thumbtack 2D model, where it actually worked pretty well. Practically, though, the actuators didn&amp;rsquo;t do much more than look cool. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t an effective way to pull on them and they took too much force to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;manipulator-hand&#34;&gt;Manipulator Hand
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven&amp;rsquo;t really mentioned it, but I made two models of hand. The one I&amp;rsquo;ve described above took more time to design, but I also made a manipulator hand based on those helping hand things you can get for soldering. I ended up just downloading a helping hand segment from the internet and adapting a bunch of them into a hand. This ended up working &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well, and in the end the hand looked amazing. I also designed smaller claws for the ends of the manipulator fingers. I did, however, overestimate the strength of the ball joints, and they had a habit of sagging. This was probably down to tolerances, and I could have maybe designed my own segment system, but that would have taken more time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wearing-it&#34;&gt;Wearing It
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; I did a few test fits at home before the final day, and naturally found a bunch of major issues. The backboard broke, the arms were &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too long, the joints were too weak. This is a &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; lesson in testing things. I also figured out how to take the thing through doors, which proved surprisingly hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On the day I took it to school, it actually went really well. I had to remove anything that looked remotely sharp because of bureaucratic fun-sponges, but it was still impressive and quite a few people got a good laugh out of it. The arms sagged precipitously, but it ultimately worked. At one point, the clawed hand snapped off and the attachment point broke, but I was able to bodge it back together with spare parts I&amp;rsquo;d brought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;takeaways&#34;&gt;Takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document everything while building, and keep a journal of ideas. This would have made it a lot easier to write this post, and it&amp;rsquo;s an essential skill for actual engineering. I seem to enjoy recording and documenting in a markdown format like this website, so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s how I should do it in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PETG is super flexible and not great for many engineering purposes. The arms sagged more than I&amp;rsquo;d expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D printing is NOT the hammer for every nail. Building this from foam and/or aluminum extrusion would have been much lighter and more rigid. However, 3D printing &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; much easier, and amazing for prototyping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actuation is hard. It&amp;rsquo;s probably easier to put small motors wherever you need something to move and just run electrical lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think through the practical forces. How is something going to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, how is it going to work, and assume that plastic parts aren&amp;rsquo;t that strong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave more time than you expect to need. I started this project 6 months early, which gave me plenty of time to think it all through and fix issues before the final day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test everything ALL THE TIME.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring spares. No plan survives contact with the enemy, but planning helps you be prepared for &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; things go wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule of Cool trumps all in fiction, but reality has a low-tolerance policy when it comes to BS physics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have realistic and stretch goals. From the very beginning, actuated hands were a stretch goal. When that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out, I was able to revert to a &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; system that still looked cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>The Argo, or: I don&#39;t know how to organize a story properly</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-argo-or-i-dont-know-how-to-organize-a-story-properly/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 11:56:46 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-argo-or-i-dont-know-how-to-organize-a-story-properly/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-argo&#34;&gt;The Argo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I had this idea, late at night, as all good ideas arrive. An idea for a story based in hard science fiction with mild horror and thriller elements. It&amp;rsquo;s not a terribly sophisticated idea, but I liked the setting and speculative technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-setting&#34;&gt;The Setting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wanted to set this story on an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/O%27Neill_cylinder&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;O&amp;rsquo;Neil cylinder&lt;/a&gt; called the Argo. This has a few advantages, as it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty self-contained environment and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of creative freedom in the environment. However, it&amp;rsquo;s also a helluva a challenge. You have to describe the setting in a way that makes sense to an audience that&amp;rsquo;s spent their entire life on Earth. A quick rundown of features that are hard to describe and unintuitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The horizon curves up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone on the cylinder can look up and see anywhere else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;inner space&amp;rdquo; between the habitable interior surface and the exposed outer surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gravity &lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt; as you go up towards the central spoke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The wider world of the story is effectively set in the late 2300s, as humanity has started colonizing nearby star systems. FTL is impossible and near-lightspeed travel comes with insurmountable engineering challenges in the form of energy requirements and micrometor impact damage. So, the colonization ships need to be habitats capable of self-sustaining for hundreds, possibly thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This makes for a crazy cool and unique setting, but it&amp;rsquo;s also basically impossible to describe without being a god of prose or using an illustration. It&amp;rsquo;s also hard to draw a world that&amp;rsquo;s just so weird and unintuitive, and I&amp;rsquo;m not good at drawing. But, I LOVE this setting, and want to do a lot more with it, but right now, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the illustrative chops to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-characters&#34;&gt;The Characters
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dae. Our protagonist, a mechanical engineer ~20 years old working on a capstone project. That&amp;rsquo;s literally all that I developed him with. Yeah, he&amp;rsquo;s paper-thin. Following a five-man band structure, he&amp;rsquo;s nominally the Leader, but usually comes off more as the Lancer or Big Buy. When I left the story, he hadn&amp;rsquo;t really &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marc. Affable ace, best friends with Dae, who&amp;rsquo;s kinda a replacement for his often-absent parents. He switches between the Heart and the Leader. In my mind, I had him the most developed, but it&amp;rsquo;s still not great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ava. Computer programmer on the same capstone project team as Dae. I didn&amp;rsquo;t develop her much personally, but she fulfils the Smart Guy role, sometimes switching in for the Heart. Best friends with Sarah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah. Nominally the leader until she gets damseled and puppeted by Blue Sky. She has very little characterization beyond &amp;ldquo;tough guy who doesn&amp;rsquo;t take shit.&amp;rdquo; She&amp;rsquo;s basically a walking plot device, and while I planned to characterize her with a recovery from being damseled and puppeted, but stopped writing before that. I was going to do a &amp;ldquo;break the badass,&amp;rdquo; but stopped first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antonin. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t even deserve a mention, as he does basically nothing and I practically forget he exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue Sky. A moxel construction designed to maintain the Argo and protect its inhabitants, but has interpreted that directive more broadly than originally intended. It enforces a lower tech level, fights off Red Sky, and puppeteers Sarah. It&amp;rsquo;s basically amoral, only trying to fulfill the objective. Not exactly a protagonist, but was intended to be a protagonist-aligned character after they free Sarah and fight through Blue Sky&amp;rsquo;s swarms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Sky. Calls itself by a numerical address, became a paperclip maximizer focused on terraforming, as it was a bot working on the Martian terraforming effort. Intent on destroying the enclave in the Argo and using the ship&amp;rsquo;s resources to expand to the stars. The antagonist, it&amp;rsquo;s amoral, just as Blue Sky; it just has a very different objective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problems&#34;&gt;the Problems
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m just going to give a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paper-thin characters. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think them through at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncertain story. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go in with any coherent story in mind besides a few key scenes and some twine between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undeveloped world. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; my world worked before writing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undeveloped character interactions. Besides the relation between Marc and Dae, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-fixes&#34;&gt;The Fixes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writing a proper long-form story is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. I keep underestimating the difficulty and assuming I can plow through with gumption and goodwill. That&amp;rsquo;s not how the world works, and my poor decisions usually catch up with me around page 50. What I need to do is learn to think through a world &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Make notes, write everything down, come up with an organization system (maybe this website). Whenever I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to organize before, I usually run into issues with quick referencing back - I can&amp;rsquo;t find the information I need. That sounds like an issue with my organization system, and I should probably try to break things down and solve the problem like an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Also, I should write short stories of the different scenes I like to get a feel for the world. The first section of the Argo story isn&amp;rsquo;t actually that bad; I basically wrote it as a short story featuring the characters I&amp;rsquo;d figured out. I think it does an alright job at characterizing them, introducing conflict, and building suspense. Those short stories are also a smaller load to try to think through. They don&amp;rsquo;t require nearly as much long-term planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The main problem I&amp;rsquo;ll run into with trying to write short stories is that I like to think &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt;. My mind will start with a short story and spiral out to the whole fictional world. This spiraling, while enticing and initially fun, tends to gloss over details and introduce inconsistencies. I need to set a specific, pre-defined endpoint to a short story and &lt;em&gt;stick to it&lt;/em&gt;. Anything more can be the subject of a future short story or part of the larger world. Who knows, maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll make its way to a post here.&lt;/p&gt;
