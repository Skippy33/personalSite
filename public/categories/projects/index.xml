        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-inspiration&#34;&gt;The Inspiration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December 2023, I watched an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om9Id44vjKw&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;animation by Liam Vickers on youtube&lt;/a&gt; about a character named IC-0n. IC-0n&amp;rsquo;s gimmick is that she&amp;rsquo;s basically omnipotent, off-beat funny, and has a penchant for murder. And while this specific combination captivated me for a few months, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liked IC-0n&amp;rsquo;s giant robot arms. The idea had already been in my head for a while thanks to the show Inside Job, where one of the main characters invents GIANT ROBOT ARMS(!!!!). There were also a few animations where characters had mechanical wings, and I thought they looked &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cool. So, I decided I had to make some of my own. I have a 3D printer, it can&amp;rsquo;t be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; hard. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to go on. The hand I wanted to base on IC-0n&amp;rsquo;s talons, and the arm segments on Inside Job, but not much more. Most of the content I used was also animated, and the animators hadn&amp;rsquo;t really worried about the mechanical or physical feasibility of their arms, so I had a tough time trying to figure out what exactly to build. I took a few screenshots and tried to piece together exactly what I needed.
